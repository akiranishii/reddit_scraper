I don’t have a problem with this, but she does get upset with me if I don’t stay on the routine. \\n\\nFor example, she tells me when I am asking them to do something, to end the sentence with, “yes?” So they respond with yes. My natural way of communicating with them is ending the sentence with, “okay?”. Whenever she hears this, it gets her a bit frustrated with me for not using the correct word. Regardless though, the kids still listen and respond back with, “okay” same way they respond back with, “yes”. But I’m always being told I need to change my verbiage.\\n\\nI’m not going to go into every little thing, but it mostly revolves around communication and it’s all similar to this example.

Would you say these are normal 18 mo behaviors?\\n\\n1. Clinginess. Gets upset sometimes when I try to do housework. Will cry and pull on my pants legs to get me to sit down with her. She also has periods where she can be very indpendent, but goes through periods where I\\'m not even able to walk away and blow my nose.\\n\\n2. Climbs on literally everything, including the kitchen table. If she is unable to climb on something due to physical limitations she can sometimes get frustrated and start crying/screaming/stomping/throwing things etc. Throws a tantrum or completely ignores you if you tell her she is not allowed to climb something.\\n\\n3. Does not follow directions. I mean if it sounds like fun, she will. Like \"please help me throw this in the garbage\" is a fun one. But if I tell her we need to change her diaper, she runs away. In the store yesterday I asked her to walk with me, but she continuously ran off thinking it was a fun game. I sternly told her not to throw her plate yesterday and she looked right at me and threw her book. I know they say toddlers don\\'t understand most directions, but these are things I\\'m pretty confident she does understand, just chooses not to do, but maybe I\\'m wrong?\\n\\n4. Throws things (see above comment). She will also get into the drawers, pull everything out, and throw it on the floor. She has broken things from throwing them very hard. If I ask her not to throw, she still does. The only thing that seems to work is just distracting her with something else.\\n\\nMy mom was extremely helicoptery and controlling when I was growing up (and arguably still now), so I\\'m trying not to be that way with my daughter, but when she acts this way my mom tells me I let her get away with too much and I\\'m forming bad habits. Idk I guess I\\'m just looking for either reassurance that this is normal or an outside perspective to confirm that it might not be.\\n\\nJust to clarify, BTW, my daughter is extremely loving too. She gives hugs and kisses, jokes, plays. It\\'s not all horrible. But we do have our moments.',\n",

She will throw things in the trash on her own, grab and put away her own shoes, clean up messes, climb into her car seat etc. However lately this need to do everything on her own is driving me crazy at times. Not only does it take much longer to do a task, or even go anywhere, but she will also scream, cry, and sometimes tantrum if we end up helping her or doing the task if she starts taking too long. Like if we take off her jacket for her, she will cry for us to put it back on, and then take it off herself. \\n\\nThe issue is, a lot of things she’s trying to do now she isn’t quite capable of yet (like replacing the garbage bag in the trash can…that was a terrible tantrum I recently experienced). My patience is wearing thin. I love that she wants to do things on her own and feels confident enough in herself, but when we are in a rush to get somewhere or bedtime is now taking 2 hours instead of 1, I just want to yell HURRY UP! Is it bad of me to allow her to do everything on her own? Should I be more firm with boundaries and helping her when things drag on? Or maybe this is just another phase to wait out.

She will throw things in the trash on her own, grab and put away her own shoes, clean up messes, climb into her car seat etc. However lately this need to do everything on her own is driving me crazy at times. Not only does it take much longer to do a task, or even go anywhere, but she will also scream, cry, and sometimes tantrum if we end up helping her or doing the task if she starts taking too long. Like if we take off her jacket for her, she will cry for us to put it back on, and then take it off herself. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The issue is, a lot of things she’s trying to do now she isn’t quite capable of yet (like replacing the garbage bag in the trash can…that was a terrible tantrum I recently experienced). My patience is wearing thin. I love that she wants to do things on her own and feels confident enough in herself, but when we are in a rush to get somewhere or bedtime is now taking 2 hours instead of 1, I just want to yell HURRY UP! Is it bad of me to allow her to do everything on her own? Should I be more firm with boundaries and helping her when things drag on? Or maybe this is just another phase to wait out. I am exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

              "     'selftext': '  \\n\\nI am losing my mind. I cried last night and just felt overwhelming despair for how disappointing parenthood has been. My son is 16 months old and the only phase of his life that I mildly enjoyed is 10-11 ½ months. Other than that small window of time, I have been on CONSTANT edge because my son does not stop fussing. No doctor, early intervention professional, etc. has ever expressed concerns about his health or anything because there he has plenty of good days, but they aren’t usually with us (his parents). He gives his daycare teachers hell plenty of times, but they do not see nothing concerning. The problem is he is consistently awful with us and has been since birth, so I can’t tell how much is a learned behavior.\\n\\nSome insight into why I am at my wit’s end:\\n\\n1. He whines CONSTANTLY. And I have no idea why. I try to re-direct, pick him up, read him books, etc. and if it works, it is only for a few minutes. Things ebb and flow and some activities work better at times than others, but he is consistently an atomic bomb where I worry that tiny movements will set him off. Things he hates include:\\n   1. Being in his high chair\\n   2. Being in his car seat\\n   3. Being in his stroller\\n   4. Being in his Little Tykes truck\\n   5. Being confined to his playroom by a baby gate\\n   6. As a baby, being in a playpen/pack and play\\n   7. As a baby, being in any type of baby wearing wrap/device\\n   8. Eating anything except a few favorite foods\\n2. All things we are desperately trying to work on and have for months:\\n   1. Will not stop standing on furniture (couches, dining room chairs, cabinets, EVERYTHING) and has minorly hurt  himself from falling off furniture because we have to turn our backs       occasionally and not be helicopter parents. He is big enough to climb onto it himself and removing all furniture from the house is not an option.\\n   2. Throws tantrums when we don’t let him walk around the house with crayons and dangerous things like scissors/tools, cups, etc. We can NOT distract by toys once he spots a       “forbidden” object. Again, we can’t remove everything from our house.\\n   3. Will only sit at the table to eat for a few bites (unless it’s fruit) and refuses to eat anything if we don’t let him throw his plates and walk around with food. As in he will literally go all day just crying instead of eating. \\n\\nWe have tried EVERYTHING suggested to us by reddit, toddler books, daycare, etc. We always give him one item we know he’ll like. Eventually he just whined even louder and nonstop when his only liked food ran out. Daycare suggested we do what they do, which is tell him he can have the food he likes once he tries a few bites of the other food. This has done nothing except made him throw tantrums that also never end.\\n\\nWe try leaving the house but he won’t go in his stroller without going totally rigorous mortis and acting like we are killing him. He tries to run in the road, eat rocks, and sit down to throw a tantrum if I let him walk next to me. We try to go to indoor playgrounds and children’s museums but he still finds a way to hurt himself and whine. \\n\\nUnfortunately, I think this is just his temperament because he has been difficult to soothe since he came home at 2 days old and I have no idea how to re-direct it. Trying to get him to fall asleep as a newborn was 1+ hour long struggle. Everyone else seems to figure him out except us, his parents. Other people, like his paternal grandparents, tell us he doesn’t seem that difficult and it makes me feel like an even worse mother. The only thing that helps me talk myself down from feeling like a failure is that our families aren’t around frequently so they only get a glimpse of him. \\n\\nHe consistently wakes up early around 5:00-5:30am despite a 7pm bedtime. And no, later bedtimes have not helped. There have been periods of time where he slept later, but the 5am realm is most common and always has been.\\n\\n**Questions I am desperately seeking answers to:**\\n\\n* Is it expected to spend almost every waking moment following your 16 month around because they won’t stop whining or coming close to seriously hurting themselves? It stops occasionally when he finds something interesting, but it is impossible to tell what he wants so he whines despite the millions of things I offer because I have zero idea what he wants.\\n* Do you let your children cry for hours straight because they won’t eat what you serve them? Or do you save yourself at some point?\\n* Do I just let him fuss and cry in his crib for an hour until his designated waking time?\\n\\nI am at my wit’s end. No amount of therapy or Zoloft can make me happy with this life anymore. I truly wish I had never become a parent. This is NOT a blessing and I am terrified that my negative attitude around him is going to leave my child with trauma when he is older.',\n",

              "     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am losing my mind. I cried last night and just felt overwhelming despair for how disappointing parenthood has been. My son is 16 months old and the only phase of his life that I mildly enjoyed is 10-11 ½ months. Other than that small window of time, I have been on CONSTANT edge because my son does not stop fussing. No doctor, early intervention professional, etc. has ever expressed concerns about his health or anything because there he has plenty of good days, but they aren’t usually with us (his parents). He gives his daycare teachers hell plenty of times, but they do not see nothing concerning. The problem is he is consistently awful with us and has been since birth, so I can’t tell how much is a learned behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Some insight into why I am at my wit’s end:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;He whines CONSTANTLY. And I have no idea why. I try to re-direct, pick him up, read him books, etc. and if it works, it is only for a few minutes. Things ebb and flow and some activities work better at times than others, but he is consistently an atomic bomb where I worry that tiny movements will set him off. Things he hates include:\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Being in his high chair&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Being in his car seat&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Being in his stroller&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Being in his Little Tykes truck&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Being confined to his playroom by a baby gate&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;As a baby, being in a playpen/pack and play&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;As a baby, being in any type of baby wearing wrap/device&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Eating anything except a few favorite foods&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;All things we are desperately trying to work on and have for months:\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Will not stop standing on furniture (couches, dining room chairs, cabinets, EVERYTHING) and has minorly hurt  himself from falling off furniture because we have to turn our backs       occasionally and not be helicopter parents. He is big enough to climb onto it himself and removing all furniture from the house is not an option.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Throws tantrums when we don’t let him walk around the house with crayons and dangerous things like scissors/tools, cups, etc. We can NOT distract by toys once he spots a       “forbidden” object. Again, we can’t remove everything from our house.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Will only sit at the table to eat for a few bites (unless it’s fruit) and refuses to eat anything if we don’t let him throw his plates and walk around with food. As in he will literally go all day just crying instead of eating. &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We have tried EVERYTHING suggested to us by reddit, toddler books, daycare, etc. We always give him one item we know he’ll like. Eventually he just whined even louder and nonstop when his only liked food ran out. Daycare suggested we do what they do, which is tell him he can have the food he likes once he tries a few bites of the other food. This has done nothing except made him throw tantrums that also never end.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We try leaving the house but he won’t go in his stroller without going totally rigorous mortis and acting like we are killing him. He tries to run in the road, eat rocks, and sit down to throw a tantrum if I let him walk next to me. We try to go to indoor playgrounds and children’s museums but he still finds a way to hurt himself and whine. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I think this is just his temperament because he has been difficult to soothe since he came home at 2 days old and I have no idea how to re-direct it. Trying to get him to fall asleep as a newborn was 1+ hour long struggle. Everyone else seems to figure him out except us, his parents. Other people, like his paternal grandparents, tell us he doesn’t seem that difficult and it makes me feel like an even worse mother. The only thing that helps me talk myself down from feeling like a failure is that our families aren’t around frequently so they only get a glimpse of him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He consistently wakes up early around 5:00-5:30am despite a 7pm bedtime. And no, later bedtimes have not helped. There have been periods of time where he slept later, but the 5am realm is most common and always has been.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions I am desperately seeking answers to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Is it expected to spend almost every waking moment following your 16 month around because they won’t stop whining or coming close to seriously hurting themselves? It stops occasionally when he finds something interesting, but it is impossible to tell what he wants so he whines despite the millions of things I offer because I have zero idea what he wants.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Do you let your children cry for hours straight because they won’t eat what you serve them? Or do you save yourself at some point?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Do I just let him fuss and cry in his crib for an hour until his designated waking time?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am at my wit’s end. No amount of therapy or Zoloft can make me happy with this life anymore. I truly wish I had never become a parent. This is NOT a blessing and I am terrified that my negative attitude around him is going to leave my child with trauma when he is older.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

She’s use to crowded playgrounds, museums, etc. and totally showing signs that she wants to make friends. Happy to wave or talk to anyone in her path. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We finally found a daycare with a spot open and she’s having a really hard time. Clinging to the teacher most of the day and sobbing off and on. At drop off she says I can go here, there are too many kids, I need a new school. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her classroom only has about 5/6 kids but when they go to the outside playground it’s all classrooms together so like 50🤔 ages 3 all the way to school aged. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell if I’m being too soft on her but I feel like it’s too much all at once. Like I need to cut down to part time or pick her up earlier. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Is this totally normal and I’m overreacting? How long do I wait to see if she comes around? Yesterday she wouldn’t get out of the car at all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

It was hard getting her to poop on the potty but we eventually did. However, I’ve noticed that before potty training she used to poop a lot more and more consistently. She used to poop twice a day. Now she may go a day without pooping and then a day with little poops and then the next two days have consistent large poops and so on…. So my question is, is this normal or should we consider using miralax? She isn’t constituted btw, when she poops they are soft and normal looking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

She’s hit a good sleep pattern so I think we need to just rip the bandaid And do it. Should I poke a hole in it and tell her it’s broken? Cut it off and just tell her it’s gone and let her keep the animal. Binky fairy even though I think she’s too young to understand that? I know she’s going to be a hysterical mess and I want to minimize her screaming and crying and keeping us all up.

She likes wubbys but she’s down to just one with the binky still on it. She’s ATTACHED. We only let her have it in her bed and in her little bit of downtime right before bed at night but if we even go upstairs she freaks out and wants it. She’s hit a good sleep pattern so I think we need to just rip the bandaid And do it. Should I poke a hole in it and tell her it’s broken? Cut it off and just tell her it’s gone and let her keep the animal. Binky fairy even though I think she’s too young to understand that? I know she’s going to be a hysterical mess and I want to minimize her screaming and crying and keeping us all up. My older daughter was similar and she chewed through her last one and was pretty upset but after about 3 days she was fine, my younger daughter is a little less easy going so I’m not excited. Send wine and thoughts and prayers please!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

One daycare with a smaller group of kids (5 total) was part time (3 days a week), it lasted for 1 year (the lady closed). The last daycare lasted for 6 months, it has a larger group of kids (12).\\n\\nFrom the last daycare, he got kicked out because of pushing/too rough with other kids and not listening to instructions. He also hits me at home occasionally, but not his dad. We of course try to stop/redirect him when he does this. I feel like he's overstimulated when he's in larger group of kids/people. I just started going back to school last week. I still have a chance to drawback till tomorrow. But I feel a little sad because I thought I finally found a daycare that worked out for him. \\n\\nHow can I help him to not push/hit other kids? We don't hit him. The daycare provider does time out but it doesn't seem to work out for him. Do you think I should just stay home with my son? After 9 daycares, I feel like he's not ready? Or should I find a stay at home mom with less kids to watch him? Advice please. Thank you for your time! 🙏❤️\",\n",

I feel like he&amp;#39;s overstimulated when he&amp;#39;s in larger group of kids/people. I just started going back to school last week. I still have a chance to drawback till tomorrow. But I feel a little sad because I thought I finally found a daycare that worked out for him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;How can I help him to not push/hit other kids? We don&amp;#39;t hit him. The daycare provider does time out but it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to work out for him. Do you think I should just stay home with my son? After 9 daycares, I feel like he&amp;#39;s not ready? Or should I find a stay at home mom with less kids to watch him? Advice please. Thank you for your time! 🙏❤️&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

              "     'selftext': 'This is going to be a bit rambly but I just need to get it out there to process. My parents live across the country and visit a few times a year. They are here now and have been with my 2.5yo for a few days, taking her to the library, the science centre, or just hanging out with her at the apartment where they’re staying. Tonight we were all over there for dinner together and at one point my toddler picked up my dad’s almost-empty glass from the coffee table and took a sip. He immediately yelled “NAME, NO, STOP IT”, and she was visibly startled and honestly so was I. Right away I said “Hey! Don’t talk to her like that!” And he said “It’s not water”. So then I thought, ohhhh it’s booze that makes sense, but when I clarified he said no it was soda (it was mostly just melted ice left). Then he said “she knows not to drink it, she’s been told many times”, which of course made me wonder if he’s been raising his voice with her over this (or other things) over the last few days. A few minutes later over dinner when everyone was calm I said that we try not to raise our voice with her because it’s not an effective way to change behaviour. My husband bless him further explained that any attention is good attention for her and she’s more likely to repeat behaviours that get a reaction. My dad said “okay” and we moved on. The interaction lasted like, a minute. But I swear the only reason I had the courage to say that to him was from reading stories and advice on this group. So as much as the thought of a supposedly trusted caregiver yelling at my kid for something we would have taken a gentler approach to makes me sad, I feel really proud that I advocated for her, that my husband was in my corner, and that my dad seemed fine and probably won’t do it again. Thanks Reddit for giving me the tools to handle this one.',\n",

My parents live across the country and visit a few times a year. They are here now and have been with my 2.5yo for a few days, taking her to the library, the science centre, or just hanging out with her at the apartment where they’re staying. Tonight we were all over there for dinner together and at one point my toddler picked up my dad’s almost-empty glass from the coffee table and took a sip. He immediately yelled “NAME, NO, STOP IT”, and she was visibly startled and honestly so was I. Right away I said “Hey! Don’t talk to her like that!” And he said “It’s not water”. So then I thought, ohhhh it’s booze that makes sense, but when I clarified he said no it was soda (it was mostly just melted ice left). Then he said “she knows not to drink it, she’s been told many times”, which of course made me wonder if he’s been raising his voice with her over this (or other things) over the last few days. A few minutes later over dinner when everyone was calm I said that we try not to raise our voice with her because it’s not an effective way to change behaviour. My husband bless him further explained that any attention is good attention for her and she’s more likely to repeat behaviours that get a reaction. My dad said “okay” and we moved on. The interaction lasted like, a minute. But I swear the only reason I had the courage to say that to him was from reading stories and advice on this group. So as much as the thought of a supposedly trusted caregiver yelling at my kid for something we would have taken a gentler approach to makes me sad, I feel really proud that I advocated for her, that my husband was in my corner, and that my dad seemed fine and probably won’t do it again. Thanks Reddit for giving me the tools to handle this one.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

              "     'selftext': 'Edit: thank you all for your comments and tips! I posted this yesterday as a tired mom vent, and didn’t realize it will get so many responses. It made me feel less alone, and had a bit more tricks up my sleeve! So thank you. \\n\\nLots of you asked about why I’m preparing food separately. It’s a bit complicated, but my in laws live with us and my mil makes south Asian food which is a bit oily, spicy and sometimes too salty. She also adds msg in most of her meals. There’s just not much of her cooking I can feed my toddler. I must admit this has slowly becoming a problem because now we are cooking twice per meal in my household, and we are not eating the same meals as my toddler. Anyways that’s my situation in case anyone is interested! \\n\\nThere I said it, I hate it so much! I make her food from scratch, she tosses it! One day she’s all about eating avocado, then next day she doesn’t want any of it. All she wants is milk, and throws a tantrum if we don’t give her milk before her meals.

I posted this yesterday as a tired mom vent, and didn’t realize it will get so many responses. It made me feel less alone, and had a bit more tricks up my sleeve! So thank you. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Lots of you asked about why I’m preparing food separately. It’s a bit complicated, but my in laws live with us and my mil makes south Asian food which is a bit oily, spicy and sometimes too salty. She also adds msg in most of her meals. There’s just not much of her cooking I can feed my toddler. I must admit this has slowly becoming a problem because now we are cooking twice per meal in my household, and we are not eating the same meals as my toddler. Anyways that’s my situation in case anyone is interested! &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There I said it, I hate it so much! I make her food from scratch, she tosses it! One day she’s all about eating avocado, then next day she doesn’t want any of it. All she wants is milk, and throws a tantrum if we don’t give her milk before her meals. If we give in, then she drinks too much milk, and then gets constipated. Everyday I’m tossing food coz she doesn’t like this or doesn’t like that. Everyday I’m stressed out about what to make her, and even if I put food in front of her, there’s a high chance she hates it. I just gave her some ritz cookies, and now she wants to eat. I did BLW when we first started, and try to introduce her with a variety of food. She still the pickiest toddler now! Im so frustrated and stressed out of my life. What do I do? Is this a phase?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Some nights when we have told her no it’s bedtime she literally starts forcing herself to poop in her night time diaper. we know it’s not like a poop emergency every night but it’s hard to tell her she can’t poop. We tried telling her she needs to go earlier/after bath but same thing happens. Wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar!',\n",

Lately it’s once we turn the lights off and start closing her door she starts screaming and saying she has to go poop on the potty. the first couple nights we let her go sit on the potty but then she just talks and talks, wants to read etc. she does end up pooping though so it’s confusing. Some nights when we have told her no it’s bedtime she literally starts forcing herself to poop in her night time diaper. we know it’s not like a poop emergency every night but it’s hard to tell her she can’t poop. We tried telling her she needs to go earlier/after bath but same thing happens. Wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I have so many emotions about this betrayal, and then the mom guilt on top of all of it. I’m not strong enough for this right now, and I hate that it’s affecting her. Even though to her it’s probably like being on vacation. I try to do right by her, only about an hour (or 2 on days where I have a lot of cleaning to do) of screen time split up throughout the day when I’m cooking or cleaning. Healthy food, veggies with dinner, fruit for snacks. But right now I feel like I’m suffocating and can barely keep myself above water. \\n\\nI’m just cuddling with her all day, keeping her attention on the happy singing on tv while I wallow in despair. I haven’t cried in front of her or said anything bad about her dad to her. I still think she senses something, but I’m doing my best to put my best face on for her. But I feel like crap. I feel like this is breaking some parenting code. I feel like a crap mom right now.\\n\\n——————\\n\\n**Update: thank you everyone who has taken the time to read and respond. Id like to reply to everyone, but I don’t even know what to say other than thank you so so much. I do have my brother and my sister in law for support. They’ve told me whenever I’m ready they want to take me out for some me time. I’m not ready yet, but I’m still able to text my heartbroken rants to them for now. \\n\\nTo the ones suggesting Miss Rachel, that’s exactly who has been on my tv screen for the last 3 days! Although usually her voice annoys me, it’s actually been kind of soothing and I sing the songs with my daughter, and play along when she says something like “can you say open?” And we both yell “open!”\\n\\nI feel so relieved, yet also sad to know I’m not alone. So many have said they have been through this, or worse, and their toddlers survived healthy and happy. You’re all right that I need to open up about how I’m feeling to her. She’s 3.5 and just so intuitive, I can tell she knows something is up, because I don’t usually stay in pajamas all day and cuddle on the couch. \\n\\nI didn’t mention in the original post I have a 1 year old too. I don’t feel as worried for him as I do for my 3.5 year old. Maybe that’s wrong of me idk. It just feels different with him, because he’s so little I doubt he’s going to remember this even a day from now. But my 3.5 year old is so smart, and so intuitive. She remembers things months later. She remembers things we did weeks ago. So it just feels like this will affect her more than it will my younger kid. He’s really clingy to me, always has been, and so he’s just been laying on the couch with us, content to play with his feet, or occasionally watch miss Rachel with us when there’s a song on. When he’s bored he just gets up and goes and plays with his toys, and usually my 3.5yo will get up with him and go play with him, or scold him for touching one of her toys.\\n\\nI did struggle with PPD for awhile after we had our 1 year old, before I started therapy and medication. In the past, whenever I tell her if I’m sad or mad or anxious, she asks why. I guess that’s why I’ve been so afraid of letting her know I’m sad right now. I know she’ll ask why. I would never try to affect her relationship with him, but I’m not sure what I can say. I know I can tell her I’m sad, and cry in front of her, but I’m lost on what to do after. When she wants to know why, and how she can help. She always wants to help. When she’s seen me cry before she always says “aww are you crying? Let me give you a hug, that will make you feel happy!” or she gives me a stuffed animal and says “here you can play with this, playing makes me so happy!” She’s the sweetest (when she wants to be lol)\\n\\nAnyway, this update has been longer than the original post itself. I just wanted to make it so I wouldn’t have to type this all out over and over again. \\n\\nI truly from every inch of my heart appreciate each and every one of you, I feel lost and afraid right now and reading these comments has given me just a brief glimmer of happiness. Someone said in shock, and I think they’re right. This was a shock. My whole world feels turned upside down. Everything we worked for, everything we planned for, every goal we set. And it’s just done with no warning, the life we had and wanted to have is over. Maybe I’ll forgive him one day, and maybe even try marriage counseling to see if we can salvage this. But right now it’s just pain. But I’m still standing, I’m still here, the sun still rises through the rain. We’ll get through this, I know we will. I can’t say it enough, thank you.**',\n",

Let me give you a hug, that will make you feel happy!” or she gives me a stuffed animal and says “here you can play with this, playing makes me so happy!” She’s the sweetest (when she wants to be lol)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this update has been longer than the original post itself. I just wanted to make it so I wouldn’t have to type this all out over and over again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I truly from every inch of my heart appreciate each and every one of you, I feel lost and afraid right now and reading these comments has given me just a brief glimmer of happiness. Someone said in shock, and I think they’re right. This was a shock. My whole world feels turned upside down. Everything we worked for, everything we planned for, every goal we set. And it’s just done with no warning, the life we had and wanted to have is over. Maybe I’ll forgive him one day, and maybe even try marriage counseling to see if we can salvage this. But right now it’s just pain. But I’m still standing, I’m still here, the sun still rises through the rain. We’ll get through this, I know we will. I can’t say it enough, thank you.**&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

That was a few months ago and I can't get her back in her crib. I'm a first time mom and was pretty anxious from the start, so her crib was right next to our bed right away. First couple of nights home she did sleep next to me but that was because I had a c-section and reaching into the crib to grab her for late night feedings was almost impossible. I had gotten one of the air bubbles from surgery and the pain was intense. Once I healed she did go to sleep in her crib, still next to our bed. And slept good. She's always been a good sleeper. But a couple months ago she got really sick and it was easier to prop her up next to me on my pillow to help her breathe and make sure she was OK in the middle of the night. Now whenever I try to put her back in her crib she cries! Even if she falls asleep next to me and I go to put her in her crib once she's asleep it's almost like as soon as she feels herself being lowered she snaps awake and cries. She sleeps fine at nap time without being next to me. I've tried waiting until she was really tired, tried sitting next to her while she's in the crib. The crib is still next to our bed too. But she just breaks down, full blown coughing crying fits, until I put her in her spot on my bed and she calms right down and falls asleep. I've tried letting her cry it out but my husband doesn't like that. I don't know what to do. She does have another crib in her own room but I don't know if that will work. I have not tried that yet.

My toddler (born July 2020) has always enjoyed baths, got upset when it was time to get out etc. Have never had an incident in the tub that would lead to fear. Since we’ve moved she screams bloody murder when put in the tub. She will hide when she hears the water. I’ve tried to get in with her, put her in with her little sister, even had daddy offer to get in with her. We’ve bought new toys. Bubbles. Colored bubbles. Crayons. Lights. Offered chocolate treats. Everything. The bathroom is set up almost identical to our old place, the only thing is, the tub is a bit deeper. I tried using a clear Rubbermaid container and filling it with water to bathe her and she still freaks out. She won’t tell us why, she just says no no no. She has no rashes, or any other symptoms I can find or know of that would make a bath uncomfortable for her. It’s been a month and she still reacts the same. I do not want to make bathing a traumatic event for her, but she’s a messy toddler and definitely needs baths. Anyone else dealt with this? Any ideas?',\n",

My toddler (born July 2020) has always enjoyed baths, got upset when it was time to get out etc. Have never had an incident in the tub that would lead to fear. Since we’ve moved she screams bloody murder when put in the tub. She will hide when she hears the water. I’ve tried to get in with her, put her in with her little sister, even had daddy offer to get in with her. We’ve bought new toys. Bubbles. Colored bubbles. Crayons. Lights. Offered chocolate treats. Everything. The bathroom is set up almost identical to our old place, the only thing is, the tub is a bit deeper. I tried using a clear Rubbermaid container and filling it with water to bathe her and she still freaks out. She won’t tell us why, she just says no no no. She has no rashes, or any other symptoms I can find or know of that would make a bath uncomfortable for her. It’s been a month and she still reacts the same. I do not want to make bathing a traumatic event for her, but she’s a messy toddler and definitely needs baths. Anyone else dealt with this? Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

She's been quite sick with strep (that the LO brought home from daycare to share) so I've been taking a bigger role than normal in taking care of him. Basically, he and I hung out all weekend together while she rested as well as bringing him to work with me the last couple of days. So, for example, when we got home from work last night, he wanted absolutely nothing to do with my wife. He screamed and yelled and refused to do anything she asked him to do. Yet, as soon as I walked into the room and asked him to do the exact same thing, he complied quickly and did the thing (probably was getting pj's on or eating dinner, don't quite remember what it was). This made my wife feel like crap, which on top of the strep deal, just crushed her spirits. I've tried talking to him a bit on our drive home, saying things like 'mommy is really excited to see us' and 'please be nice to mommy'. In that moment, he's excited to get home to see her too but as soon as we walk in the door, he flips and becomes a raging asshole. You can see the light dim in her eyes and I feel so bad for her about the whole thing. Worst was overnight last night. \\nHe woke up 2-3am and she went in to calm him. As soon as she walked in the room, he starts wailing like you wouldn't believe. She came back to our room and asked me to try going in. As soon as he saw me, he calmed down and asked for a hug and cuddle. We normally share duties pretty 50/50 but shes often sick and needs rest or is at doctors often. Is there anything I can do to help  his AH tendencies or is this some stage he's going through? We do believe he's going through a growth spurt and is simultaneously ditching his weekday nap.

Yet, as soon as I walked into the room and asked him to do the exact same thing, he complied quickly and did the thing (probably was getting pj&amp;#39;s on or eating dinner, don&amp;#39;t quite remember what it was). This made my wife feel like crap, which on top of the strep deal, just crushed her spirits. I&amp;#39;ve tried talking to him a bit on our drive home, saying things like &amp;#39;mommy is really excited to see us&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;please be nice to mommy&amp;#39;. In that moment, he&amp;#39;s excited to get home to see her too but as soon as we walk in the door, he flips and becomes a raging asshole. You can see the light dim in her eyes and I feel so bad for her about the whole thing. Worst was overnight last night. \\nHe woke up 2-3am and she went in to calm him. As soon as she walked in the room, he starts wailing like you wouldn&amp;#39;t believe. She came back to our room and asked me to try going in. As soon as he saw me, he calmed down and asked for a hug and cuddle. We normally share duties pretty 50/50 but shes often sick and needs rest or is at doctors often. Is there anything I can do to help  his AH tendencies or is this some stage he&amp;#39;s going through? We do believe he&amp;#39;s going through a growth spurt and is simultaneously ditching his weekday nap. Help!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",
